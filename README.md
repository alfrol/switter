# Switter app

Author: Alexander Frolov

**NB!** Similarities between this app and products other than official Twitter app must be considered as a coincidence.

## Details

This project was created during the course "Web Applications" at the university.

The goal was to create a simple [Twitter app](https://twitter.com) clone using PHP and MySQL. The code was uploaded to the university server.

The application can be found [here](http://dijkstra.cs.ttu.ee/~alfrol/prax4/login).
